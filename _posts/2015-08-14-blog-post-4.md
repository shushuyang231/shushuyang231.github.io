AI Companion: The AI That Reaches Out First

Imagine an AI that doesn't just wait for your questions, but actually "thinks" of you.

AI Companion is a smart dialogue application focused purely on the "experience of companionship." Unlike traditional, reactive assistants, it allows you to define unique personalities for every conversation—whether it's a gentle, supportive friend, a witty and sarcastic pal, a scholarly mentor, or any character you can imagine.

The game-changer: It initiates the conversation.

Within your set time intervals, the AI will reference your past chats to naturally pick up a topic, share a thought, or simply ask, "How’s your day going?" Even when the app is closed, it stays ready in the background to send you a notification at the scheduled time.

This isn't just an input-output language model; it’s an immersive, ongoing relationship.

How you can use it:

Language Practice: Let the AI act as a native speaker who checks in on you.

Roleplay & Writing: Engage in deep, interactive storytelling with fictional characters.

The "Strict Coach": Set up a persona to check your progress and keep you disciplined.

Daily Venting: A safe, private space to share your thoughts at the end of the day.

The app supports major APIs like OpenAI, Claude, and DeepSeek. You retain full control over your data and privacy, as all conversation logs are stored locally on your device.

Core Highlights

🔔 Proactive Messaging – The AI doesn't wait for you to speak first. It initiates chats at set intervals via system notifications, even if the app is closed.

🎭 Multi-Character Management – Every conversation has its own independent persona, temperature parameters, and background themes. No "personality bleed" between characters.

🔒 Character Lock Mechanism – Built-in advanced prompting ensures the AI stays "in character" even during long conversations, maintaining its unique persona.

🎨 Highly Customizable – Personalize chat backgrounds, UI colors, reply styles, and memory length.

🌐 Open API Integration – Supports any service compatible with the OpenAI format. Use your own API keys; your data never passes through a third party.

📱 Local-First Privacy – All chat history is stored locally. No accounts, no cloud uploads, and total privacy.

Permissions Explained

Network Access: To connect to your chosen AI API service for sending and receiving messages.

Push Notifications: To alert you when the AI proactively sends a message (can be disabled in settings).

Storage Access: To allow you to select images from your gallery for custom chat backgrounds (triggered only by your choice).

This app collects no personal data, contains no ads, and never uploads your conversations to any server. Your API keys remain strictly on your device.
